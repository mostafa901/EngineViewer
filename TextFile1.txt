        todo: understand how the saved scene translation of geometry data works. so maybe we can expedite writing it instead of a very long engine_Geometry class.

        ****************
        things to remember:
        
        CAMERA:
        --------
        setting farclip to float.maximum value, will return back undesirable results such as picking from scene will fail.

        ZONE:
        ------
        Fog.endvalue is the end of visibility even if fog bounding size is larger.

        Material:
        ---------
        Saving material that is not previously saved on HDD outputs nothing. must be saved 1st then save scene.
